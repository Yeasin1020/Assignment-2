                    <h1>Features You will <br> love & enjoy</h1>
                    <p>Every project has stakeholders, often with competing
                        ideas of what the ideal version of the final product
                        should be. Thatâ€™s why feature prioritization is so often
                        a balancing act,and expectations of different user
                        types,
                        business leaders, and other stakeholders.</p>

                        <p>A major difference between a desktop and mobile
                            device lies in a data plan vs. the need to have a
                            constant wifi connection. Mobile devices have the
                            advantage of being able to tap into a cellular
                            network to stay connected to the web.</p>
